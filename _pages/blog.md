FUN FACT

I have been to 15 countries in Asia, America and Europe. I have had many incredible opportunities to see, observer and experience how people are living their lives in different parts of the world. Traveling abroad opens my eyes to how large the world truly is, how people co-exist on this earth and helps me realize how small part in this world I actually occupy.

Next stops of my plan will be Oceania and Africa :)

Besides, during free time I enjoy doing yoga and teaching Maths & English.
