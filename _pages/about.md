## Fun facts

I have been to more than 15 countries in Asia, America, Europe and Africa. I have had many incredible opportunities to see, observe and experience how people are living their lives in different parts of the world. Traveling abroad opens my eyes to how large the world truly is, how people co-exist on this Earth and helps me realize how small part in this world I actually occupy. 

Next stops will be Oceania and Antarctica :)

I also represented Vietnam in World Youth Forum 2019 held in Sharm Egypt, in which I had the chance to meet young professionals from all around the world and discuss about how technological advancements, Artificial Intelligence applications can contribute to industrial revolution and entrepreneurship development.

Besides, during free time I enjoy doing yoga and teaching English to students in Vietnam.
